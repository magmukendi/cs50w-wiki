# cs50w-wiki
A Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia built with HTML, CSS, and Django as one of the project from [cs50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/). 

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is a free online encyclipedia that consists of a numberof encyclopedia entries on various topics.

### Features and How does it works :

  - It has an **Entry Page**: where the user can see the content of each each encyclopedia individually.
  - It has and **Index Page**: where all the encyclopedias are listed. The user can click on any entry name to be taken direcly to the entry page of the encyclopedia.
  - A **Search** field: Allowing the user to type a query for finding any encyclopedia entry. If the query corresponds to one entry's title, the user will  be redirected to that entry page. If the query does not match the name of an encyclopedia entry, the user should instead be taken to a page displaying a list of all entries that contain the query in thei title. Clicking one of the results title should take the user to that encyclopedia.
  - A **New Page**: There is a "Create New Page" button taking the user to a new page where they can create a new encyclopedia entry. The user will be able to enter a title and the body of the encyclopedia. 
  - An **Edit Page**: There will be an edit button on each entry page. That button allows the user to update the content of the encyclopedia.
  - **Random Page**: There is a "Random Page" button that takes the user to a random encyclopedia entry.
  - **Markdown to HTML Conversion**:  On each entry's page, any markdown content is be converted to HTML before being displayed to the user.
